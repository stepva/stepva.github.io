I brewed it mostly with the V60 at home in Prague during my February holidays, and my mom really enjoyed this one. However, the preparation was really interesting. First of all, A LOT of ground coffee was always left in the insides of the grinder, like a really large amount. Again, I sort of expected it from the washed coffees, but this one was extreme.

I also managed to experiment a bit with the AeroPress \"espresso-like\" brews, and it was successful, with a full and aromatic taste.
