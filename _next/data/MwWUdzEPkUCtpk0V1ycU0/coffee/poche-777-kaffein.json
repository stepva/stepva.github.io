I went to one such on a bike, tasting the perfect cycle paths in the city center for the first time.

The package points to a more fruity and light-roasted coffee, although their website presents it as dark-roasted.

When I bought it, it was already quite old - almost two months, with a roast date of 25th April, which I didn't really like. Overall, as I'm writing this quite late, I don't remember much about the coffee itself - definitely nothing bad, but probably again too difficult to master and maybe overpriced, given everything around it.","marks":[],"data":{}}]}]},"written_at":"2023-09-24T15:45:11.344Z","updated_at":"2023-09-24T15:45:11.344Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
