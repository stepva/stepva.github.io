In my mind, Malta was this tiny island where the Mediterranean and Arabic cultures mixed together and I knew it mainly for its online gambling boom over the last years, acting as a safe (and probably tax) haven for multiple European betting companies. My sister was joking that it was just a rock in the sea and that we should have gone somewhere else instead, but that would have been a huge mistake. Malta is amazing, we made the most of the 4 days we had there, and I think (and hope) I'll come back in the future.
