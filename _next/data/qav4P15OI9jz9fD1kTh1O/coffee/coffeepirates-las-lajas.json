The roasted beans had a nice dark colour, with a \"dark\" fruity smell - almost like red wine, nothing too crazy or tropical. I mainly used the V60 for brewing, but this coffee proved to be really challenging. It smelled amazing every time, but the taste was rather disappointing during the first few brews. I struggled with quite fast brewing time (around 2:15) and the beginnings were always bitter, which then got better and more flavourful as it cooled down.
