The coffee takes its name from the 60-acre farm, Finca Las Lajas, located in the <b>Sabanilla district of the Alajuela province in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, </b>a major coffee-producing area.<b> </b>It is located at around 1550 MASL in volcanic soil.<b> </b>Farmed and then processed in a natural way by Oscar and Francisca Chac칩n, who started with this method after the 2008 earthquake which disrupted the electricity and water supply, the two main varieties are <b>Caturra and Catuai</b>, Bourbon mutations bred in Brazil, with dark red or yellow pulps.</p><p>The Las Lajas micro-mill is already well-established in the coffee world. Oscar and Francisca focus primarily on honey and natural processing, but they frequently experiment with new methods as well as trialing and cultivating new varietals. This particular natural processing type is called <b>Alma Negra</b>, in which the drying starts in a greenhouse where it is also piled up at night, and then moved to the drying beds on a patio during the day.</p><p>The taste profile and expectations were set to a <b>medium to strong body</b>, with sweet acidity and flavour notes of <b>nougat, blueberry, cherry, and dried fig</b>. The roasted beans had a nice dark colour, with a &quot;dark&quot; fruity smell - almost like red wine, nothing too crazy or tropical. I mainly used the V60 for brewing, but this coffee proved to be really challenging. It smelled amazing every time, but the taste was rather disappointing during the first few brews. I struggled with quite fast brewing time (around 2:15) and the beginnings were always bitter, which then got better and more flavourful as it cooled down. Trial and error led me to a finer grind (1.9.0 on my Q2), but I still wasn&#x27;t really satisfied.</p><p>In February I brought it with me to the office and my colleague Petr gave it a shot with his V60 method. He let it bloom in the standard way, then poured almost half of the total amount of water and swirled it significantly with a spoon, which should <b>highlight the fruity tones</b>. And I have to say that he was successful, it tasted really well, especially the nougat and blueberry. Still, I think this coffee might have been too challenging for me to master and prepare well with the not-so-great water I have available in Vienna (and perhaps the lack of skill as well).</p><p class="text-sm"><ul><li><p><i></i><a href="https://coffeepirates.at/product/costa-rica-90-las-lajas-natural"><i>coffeepirates.at</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i></i><a href="https://eclipsecoffeeroasters.com/en-eu/products/los-lajas-costa-rica2?variant=31982447624305"><i>eclipsecoffeeroasters.com</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i></i><a href="https://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/product/costa-rica-finca-las-lajas/"><i>monmouthcoffee.co.uk</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i></i><a href="https://en.neroscurocoffee.com/products/las-lajas-alma-negra-natural-sabanilla-de-alajuela"><i>neroscurocoffee.com</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i>Petra Vesel치: Velk치 kniha o k치v캩</i></p></li></ul><p></p></p><p class="text-right text-sm italic"> <!-- -->bought on <!-- -->24 Jan 2023<!-- --> <br/>written<!-- --> on<!-- --> <!-- -->22 Mar 2023</p><p class="text-right italic"></p></div></div></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"游뻟릖 Las Lajas from 游뷣릖 CoffeePirates","slug":"coffeepirates-las-lajas","excerpt":"A highly-rated roast from the first specialty coffee shop in Vienna, with beans from a famous farm in Costa Rica.
