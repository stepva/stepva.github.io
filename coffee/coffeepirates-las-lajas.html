The roasted beans had a nice dark colour, with a &quot;dark&quot; fruity smell - almost like red wine, nothing too crazy or tropical. I mainly used the V60 for brewing, but this coffee proved to be really challenging. It smelled amazing every time, but the taste was rather disappointing during the first few brews. I struggled with quite fast brewing time (around 2:15) and the beginnings were always bitter, which then got better and more flavourful as it cooled down. Trial and error led me to a finer grind (1.9.0 on my Q2), but I still wasn&#x27;t really satisfied.</p><p>In February I brought it with me to the office and my colleague Petr gave it a shot with his V60 method. He let it bloom in the standard way, then poured almost half of the total amount of water and swirled it significantly with a spoon, which should <b>highlight the fruity tones</b>. And I have to say that he was successful, it tasted really well, especially the nougat and blueberry. Still, I think this coffee might have been too challenging for me to master and prepare well with the not-so-great water I have available in Vienna (and perhaps the lack of skill as well).</p><p class="text-sm"><ul><li><p><i></i><a href="https://coffeepirates.at/product/costa-rica-90-las-lajas-natural"><i>coffeepirates.at</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i></i><a href="https://eclipsecoffeeroasters.com/en-eu/products/los-lajas-costa-rica2?variant=31982447624305"><i>eclipsecoffeeroasters.com</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i></i><a href="https://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/product/costa-rica-finca-las-lajas/"><i>monmouthcoffee.co.uk</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i></i><a href="https://en.neroscurocoffee.com/products/las-lajas-alma-negra-natural-sabanilla-de-alajuela"><i>neroscurocoffee.com</i></a><i></i></p></li><li><p><i>Petra Veselá: Velká kniha o kávě</i></p></li></ul><p></p></p><p class="text-right text-sm italic"> <!-- -->bought on <!-- -->24 Jan 2023<!-- --> <br/>written<!-- --> on<!-- --> <!-- -->22 Mar 2023</p><p class="text-right italic"></p></div></div></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"🇨🇷 Las Lajas from 🇦🇹 CoffeePirates","slug":"coffeepirates-las-lajas","excerpt":"A highly-rated roast from the first specialty coffee shop in Vienna, with beans from a famous farm in Costa Rica.
