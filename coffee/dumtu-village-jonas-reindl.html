Interestingly and sadly, I can&#x27;t really work out if it is the father, with his Nardos Coffee exporting company, or the son with his new Gujoo Trading company, who is the main person behind this coffee.

They themselves come from the classic <b>mixed heirloom</b> variety, a common name for wild varieties in Ethiopia. Because of the altitude, these beans were smaller and the drying process takes a lot longer than usual, 22 to 25 days, due to the cold weather. The beans were also visibly smaller in the final roasted package.</p><p>My first impression was the strong fruity smell. The official taste profile says <b>tangerines, vanilla, and dried stone fruits</b>, together with the smell very much typical for the heirloom. Around the same time that I was starting with this coffee, James Hoffman published his new V60 1-cup technique, just in time for me, so I immediately tried it - with great success. It was my main method of preparation for this coffee and I really liked it, it was very consistent. When colder, I tasted the citruses (perhaps tangerines?).
